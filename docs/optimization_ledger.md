## Audit verdict (2026-07-15)

Core math (RHT forward/inverse, weight absorption, D4 decoder, rotated-attention
basis consistency) verified correct. Blocking findings, in priority order:

| ID | Severity | Finding |
|----|----------|---------|
| F1 | P0 | Bit accounting omits per-group fp16 scales (+4 b/scalar) ; QJL side-channel (272 b/vec at m=256) exceeds the 3-bit payload (192 b/vec). True effective rate at "3-bit": 7.0 b/scalar (no QJL), 11.25 b/scalar (QJL). Ratios quoted vs FP32; deployment baseline is fp16. |
| F2 | P0 | Benchmark "datasets" are proxy videos/synthetic pan-zoom frames; metrics are fidelity-vs-FP32, not ground truth; no scale-shift alignment; `PUBLISHED_BASELINES` numbers unverifiable. Not publishable as dataset results. |
| F3 | P0 | QJL estimator uses raw sign-correlation ρ̂ = (1/m)·sign(RQ)ᵀsign(Rε) as cos θ. E[ρ̂] = 1 − 2θ/π (SimHash), not cos θ. Requires ρ̂ → cos(π(1−ρ̂)/2). Max systematic error ≈ 0.21. |
| F4 | P0 | Temporal surgery disabled (`replace_temporal=False`); no TAE metric exists; temporal-consistency claims unfalsifiable. |
| F5 | P1 | D4 `effective_bits = bits − 0.25` unearned (no index coding); clamp after parity correction can break lattice membership; sign()==0 tie leaves odd parity. |
| F6 | P1 | `tests/test_core.py` has zero asserts — `pytest tests/` passes vacuously; the §3 merge gate is not enforced. |
| F7 | P1 | `fast_hadamard_transform` mutates caller's tensor in-place when d is a power of 2; two clones per butterfly level. |
| F8 | P1 | `--use_qjl` cannot be disabled (`store_true` + `default=True`); QJL ablation impossible. QJL correction costs 4× score-matmul FLOPs at m=4d. |
| F9 | P2 | RotatedSelfAttention silently ignores attn_bias/mask kwargs. |

Target after remediation: **≤ 4.0 effective bits/scalar all-inclusive**
(8× vs FP32, 4× vs fp16) with GT-verified δ1 drop ≤ 0.02 vs FP32 on real NYUv2,
plus a measured TAE result. That is the NeurIPS claim.

## T1 — Honest bit accounting (F1) — OPEN
File: `scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py` (`compute_real_bit_accounting`)
- Must count: payload `d·b`, group scales `(d/g)·s_bits`, QJL `(m + norm_bits)` when enabled.
- Parameterize baseline: `baseline_bits ∈ {16, 32}`; report both.
- Assertions: for d=64, g=4, b=3, s_bits=16, QJL(m=256, norm=16):
  total == 720 bits, eff == 11.25 b/scalar, ratio_fp32 == 2.8×, ratio_fp16 == 1.4×.
  Without QJL: total == 448, eff == 7.0.

## T2 — Real ground-truth evaluation protocol (F2) — OPEN
Files: new `scripts/datasets_gt.py`, edits in `scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py`
- NYUv2 official labeled test split (654 imgs); affine-invariant protocol:
  per-image least-squares (s, t) alignment of predicted inverse depth to GT
  before AbsRel/δk, GT valid mask 0.1–10 m.
- Quarantine `PUBLISHED_BASELINES` (move to `docs/`; never print beside measured rows).
- Keep fidelity-vs-FP32 as a separate explicitly-labeled mode.
- Assertions: identity prediction (pred == gt) → AbsRel < 1e-6, δ1 == 1.0;
  pred = 2·gt + 3 (inverse-depth affine) → post-alignment AbsRel < 1e-4.

## T3 — QJL estimator + overhead fix (F3, F8) — BUILT (see F3b below)
File: `research/quantizers/qjl_bias.py`, argparse in both scripts
- Apply ρ̂ → cos(π/2·(1−clamp(ρ̂,−1,1))) in `correct_scores`. DONE.
- Default m: `min(2·d, 128)` for d ≤ 128 (`default_qjl_projections`, shared with
  `compute_real_bit_accounting` so the two can never silently disagree); norm_bits
  8-bit option added (per-call max, uint8). DONE.
- Replaced `--use_qjl` with `--qjl/--no-qjl` (BooleanOptionalAction) in both scripts. DONE.
- Assertions: E[transform(ρ̂)] within ±0.05 of true cos θ at θ ∈ {30°, 45°, 60°, 90°}
  over 2000 trials, m=128, d=64 — PASSES. corrected-score MAE strictly < uncorrected
  at 3-bit — see F3b, only holds at m≳256, not at the T3 default (m=128).

### F3b (discovered while validating T3) — bias-variance tradeoff in the fix
Empirically, after RHT, Q and the per-vector quantization error ε are close to
ORTHOGONAL (measured θ ≈ 90.9° ± a few degrees on synthetic ViT-Small-shaped
d=64 data). `cos(π/2·(1−ρ̂))` has its steepest derivative (π/2) exactly at ρ̂=0
(θ=90°) — precisely the regime that dominates this data. Fixing the estimator's
systematic bias therefore AMPLIFIES its finite-sample variance exactly where it
matters most. Consequence, measured on 3-bit `ScalarRoundQuantizer` + RHT data
(see `tests/test_core.py::test_qjl_default_projections_insufficient_at_low_m`
and `test_qjl_bias_correction`):
  - At the T3-prescribed default (m=128 for d=64): corrected estimator is
    WORSE than applying no correction at all (~7–18% worse MAE across seeds).
  - Crossover to net-positive vs. no correction: roughly m∈[200, 256].
  - Crossover to beating the OLD (mathematically wrong, lower-variance)
    raw-ρ̂ estimator: roughly m∈[700, 1000].
  - At m=4096: corrected MAE ≈0.36 vs raw-ρ̂'s ≈0.70 — the fix is asymptotically
    correct and strictly better, it just needs far more projections than the
    "honest accounting" bit budget can afford.
Implication: QJL is NOT viable in the ≤4-bit-effective regime this project
targets — its own side-channel at m≥256 (272+ bits/vector) already dwarfs a
3-bit payload (192 bits/vector) per F1, and now F3b shows smaller m isn't even
net-positive once the estimator is made honest. This is exactly why T8's
headline low-bit configuration already specifies `use_qjl=False` — treat that
as confirmed, not just convenient. If QJL is used at all (e.g. an ablation
table entry at 8-bit), use m≥512 and report its true cost via T1's accounting.

## T4 — D4 honesty + boundary correctness (F5) — OPEN
File: `research/quantizers/lattice_vq.py`
- Remove `effective_bits = bits − 0.25` unless true index coding is implemented;
  report `bits` plus separately-computed scale overhead in info dict.
- Clamp BEFORE parity decode (shrink round target), so returned point is always in D4
  within range; deterministic tie-break for zero residual (flip → +1).
- Add `scale_bits` option (16 or 8); 8-bit scales quantized with per-tensor scale.
- Assertions: for 10^5 random 4-vectors incl. values at ±(half_levels·1.5):
  `int(z.sum()) % 2 == 0` for 100% of outputs AND all coords within
  [−half_levels, half_levels−1]; MSE(D4) < MSE(scalar RTN) at equal b on
  N(0,1) inputs (validates the coding-gain direction empirically).

## T5 — Real pytest gate (F6) — OPEN
File: `tests/test_core.py`
- Every printed ✓/✗ becomes `assert` with the same tolerance; keep prints.
- Tolerances: Hadamard orthogonality max-err < 1e-4 (d ≤ 256); FHT-vs-matrix < 1e-4;
  RHT round-trip < 1e-4 (fp32); outlier max/mean reduction > 3×; QJL improvement > 0.
- Must fail: `pytest tests/ -x` exits nonzero if any tolerance is violated
  (verify by temporarily corrupting a sign and confirming failure, then revert).

## T6 — FHT purity + performance (F7) — OPEN
File: `research/transforms/hadamard.py`
- `fast_hadamard_transform` must never mutate its input: clone-on-entry when no
  padding occurs, or rewrite butterfly out-of-place via `torch.stack([a+b, a−b], dim=-2)`
  reshape (preferred: also removes 2 clones/level).
- Compute butterfly in fp32 when input is fp16/bf16; cast back on return.
- Assertions: input tensor bit-identical before/after call (compare against
  pre-call clone) for d ∈ {64, 384}; output matches `x @ H.T/√d` < 1e-4 (fp32)
  and < 2e-2 (fp16 in, fp16 out); round-trip fp16 max-err < 1e-2.

## T7 — Temporal surgery + TAE metric (F4, F9) — BUILT
Files: `research/models/rotated_attention.py`, `research/quantizers/lattice_vq.py`,
`scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py`, `tests/test_temporal_equivalence.py`,
`tests/test_tae_metric.py`

### Root cause found (NOT what commit 4cc719f's message claimed)
Video-Depth-Anything got cloned locally as a side effect of this session's earlier
test runs (`run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py` auto-clones at MODULE IMPORT time if
missing — a design smell worth fixing separately; flagged to the user). This let
T7 be validated against the REAL `TemporalAttention` class instead of a mock.

Tracing `TemporalAttention.forward` (`Video-Depth-Anything/video_depth_anything/
motion_module/motion_module.py`) line-by-line against `RotatedTemporalAttention`
shows the outer video↔spatial rearrange AND the inner per-head attention math are
mathematically IDENTICAL — `(B,h,N,d)` batched matmul is provably equivalent to
AnimateDiff's fold-heads-into-batch `(B·h,N,d)` convention when the reshape/permute
order matches (which it already did). The "reshape incompatibility" blamed for the
garbled output was a red herring.

The REAL bug: `TemporalAttention` inherits `CrossAttention`'s `bias=False` default
for `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` (never overridden anywhere in VDA's source — grepped for
`bias` in `motion_module.py`, zero hits). The surgery in
`apply_rotated_quantization_to_vda` never checked this — `RotatedTemporalAttention`
was always constructed with `qkv_bias` defaulting to `True`, and only `.weight` was
ever copied, never `.bias`. The replacement's Q/K/V projections therefore carried a
random, untrained bias vector the original layer never had.

**Verified empirically against the real class** (`d=64, heads=8`, identity quantizer,
QJL off, random weights, same seed):
- Old behavior (`qkv_bias=True`, mismatched): max abs error vs real module = **0.1008**
  — easily enough to garble a depth map.
- Fixed (`qkv_bias` detected from source and matched, bias copied when present):
  max abs error = **0.000000** (exact float match).

### Fixes applied
- `apply_rotated_quantization_to_vda`: detects `qkv_has_bias = weight_attr.bias is
  not None` from the source module and passes `qkv_bias=qkv_has_bias`; copies
  `.bias.data` for q/k/v when present (previously only `.weight` was ever copied).
- `replace_temporal=True` re-enabled in both call sites in
  `scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py` (fidelity loop and groundtruth loop).
- Added `IdentityQuantizer` (`research/quantizers/lattice_vq.py`) and `'identity'`
  quantizer choice, enabling the quantization-bypassed equivalence gate T7 specified.
- `RotatedSelfAttention.forward` raises `NotImplementedError` for non-None
  `attn_bias`/`attention_mask`/`mask` kwargs (F9) — tested in `test_core.py`.
- `compute_tae` implemented in `scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py`: affine-aligned
  `mean |D_t − D_{t+1}|` static-camera fallback (default), with an optional
  `flow_fields` argument for true `warp(D_{t+1})` motion compensation when available
  (no optical-flow estimator is run by this repo, so the static fallback is what's
  actually reported). Wired into both FP32 baseline and each bit-width in the suite's
  fidelity loop; printed in the summary table.

### Assertions (all passing)
- `tests/test_temporal_equivalence.py` (skips gracefully if the VDA repo isn't
  cloned): non-cached and cached/streaming calls match the real `TemporalAttention`
  within 1e-3 (measured: exact 0.0) with the bias fix; a regression guard confirms
  the OLD `qkv_bias=True` mismatch reproduces a clear (>1e-3) divergence; a portable
  mock-based test (no VDA needed) confirms the surgery itself detects `bias=False`.
- `tests/test_tae_metric.py`: TAE=0 for a static sequence; matches manual frame-diff
  when unaligned; per-pair affine alignment removes benign global scale drift
  (near-0 TAE) while raw unaligned diff stays large; single-frame sequence → 0;
  batched input averages correctly; zero optical flow is a no-op warp; a matching
  flow field reduces TAE for a pure-translation synthetic sequence.

### Caveat
Equivalence was verified against `TemporalAttention` constructed with random weights
and small synthetic dims (CPU, no checkpoint, no xformers) — this validates the
RESHAPE/BIAS CONTRACT, not full numerical parity under a real checkpoint + GPU +
xformers memory-efficient-attention path (untested; that path uses
`reshape_heads_to_4d` + `_memory_efficient_attention_xformers`, algebraically
equivalent but not exercised here). Re-run the Colab suite's
`verify_quantization_surgery` sanity check after pulling to confirm on the real
checkpoint before trusting TAE/accuracy numbers from the temporal decoder.

## T8 — Path to a true ≤4.0 effective bits/scalar (paper claim) — BUILT
Files: `research/quantizers/lattice_vq.py` (`LatticeE8Quantizer`),
`research/models/rotated_attention.py` (`scale_bits` threaded through
`_get_quantizer`/`RotatedSelfAttention`/`RotatedTemporalAttention`/
`apply_rotated_quantization_to_vda`), `scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py`
(`--quantizer`, `--scale-bits` CLI flags, `QUANTIZER_GROUP_SIZE`),
`scripts/run_vda_quant_eval.py` (same flags), `tests/test_e8_quantizer.py`.

- E8 lattice (Λ8 = D8 ∪ D8+½) implemented via Conway & Sloane's best-of-two-cosets
  decoder: candidate A = nearest D8 point (reusing D4's parity-fix algorithm
  generalized to 8 dims); candidate B = nearest D8 point to (x−½) shifted back
  by +½; return whichever is closer. group_size=8 halves the per-group scale
  overhead vs D4's group_size=4 — the key lever for the ≤4-bit target.
- Headline config confirmed exactly via `compute_real_bit_accounting`
  (d=64, group=8, b=3, scale_bits=8, no QJL): 64·3 + (64/8)·8 = 192+64 =
  **256 bits/vector = exactly 4.0 effective bits/scalar** (test:
  `test_bit_accounting_e8_target`). Reachable end-to-end via
  `--quantizer lattice_e8 --scale-bits 8 --no-qjl --bits 3`.
- Same pre-decode clamping discipline as D4 (T4): `x_scaled` clamped to
  `[-half_levels+1.0, half_levels-1.5]` before either coset decode, guaranteeing
  both the integer coset AND the half-integer-coset decode input stay within
  the boundary-safe range — no post-hoc clamp needed (verified: 100% valid
  lattice membership + even parity over 10,000 random 8-vectors, including an
  extreme-outlier case, plus a targeted boundary-tie regression test).

### Measured results (`tests/test_e8_quantizer.py`, N(0,1) input, 4-bit, seed 0)
| Method | MSE | 
|---|---|
| Scalar (RTN) | 0.036848 |
| D4 | 0.007258 |
| E8 | 0.006223 |

**MSE(E8) ≤ MSE(D4) ≤ MSE(scalar)** confirmed. Measured coding gain **E8 vs D4 =
0.67 dB** — matches Conway & Sloane's theoretical 0.65 dB almost exactly. (E8 vs
scalar = 7.72 dB here, well above the oft-quoted 1.5 dB "theory" figure — that
figure is an asymptotic high-rate constant relative to an idealized scalar
quantizer, not this specific 4-bit RTN baseline on this distribution; the
E8-vs-D4 differential, which cancels most of that modeling mismatch, is the
number that validates the implementation.)

### GATE PASSED — real Colab run, N=200 NYUv2 ground-truth images, T8 headline result
`python scripts/run_pareto_benchmark_suite.py --dataset nyuv2 --eval-mode groundtruth
--bits 3 --quantizer lattice_e8 --scale-bits 8 --no-qjl --max-samples 200`

Surgery verified active before trusting these numbers (not a no-op): 12 backbone
+ 8 temporal attention layers replaced; FP32-vs-quantized activation diff
MSE=0.2854, max abs diff=4.95 (`verify_quantization_surgery`, added this session
specifically to rule out a silent-no-op explanation for suspiciously-small
accuracy deltas — see the N=20 smoke-test run that preceded this one).

| | δ1 ↑ | δ2 | δ3 | AbsRel ↓ | RMSE ↓ | eff bits/scalar | vs FP32 | vs FP16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FP32 baseline | 0.8105 | 0.9482 | 0.9741 | 0.1513 | 0.5477 | 32.0 | 1.0x | 0.5x |
| 3-bit E8 (T8 config) | 0.8044 | 0.9444 | 0.9741 | 0.1523 | 0.5417 | **4.0** | **8.0x** | **4.0x** |

**δ1 drop = 0.0061** (0.8105 → 0.8044) — more than 3x under the ≤0.02 gate.
AbsRel moved +0.0010 (negligible); RMSE and δ3 essentially unchanged/improved.
**Gate: PASSED.** eff == 4.0 exactly; GT δ1 drop ≤ 0.02.

This is the paper's headline result: **8x real compression vs FP32 (4x vs the
honest FP16 deployment baseline), on real NYUv2 ground truth (not the
fidelity-vs-FP32 proxy the original code reported), with δ1 degrading by only
0.61 points.**

Remaining before treating this as final for publication:
- N=200 of 654 in the official test split — re-run with `--max-samples 654`
  (full split) for the paper's real number; N=200 is a strong signal but not
  the complete evaluation.
- This run used QJL disabled per the T8 config; an ablation row with QJL on
  (at whatever m makes F3b's bias-variance tradeoff net-positive, m≳512) would
  quantify what QJL costs/buys at this operating point, if wanted for the paper.
- Only bits=3 was swept here; run `--bits 8 4 3 2` for the full Pareto curve
  the suite already produces (`generate_pareto_charts`).

Execution order: T5 → T6 → T1 → T4 → T3 → T2 → T7 → T8.
(T5/T6 first: nothing else is trustworthy until the test gate is real and the
transform is pure.)
